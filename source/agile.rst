Idea
---------------------------------
Agile Manifesto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Scrum & Kanban

Bug tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*IEEE Standard Classification for Software Anomalies*:

- **Blocking**: Testing is inhibited or suspended pending correction or identification of suitable workaround.
- **Critical**: Essential operations are unavoidably disrupted, safety is jeopardized, and security is compromised.
- **Major**: Essential operations are affected but can proceed.
- **Minor**: Nonessential operations are disrupted.
- **Inconsequential**: No significant impact on operations.


Tools
